export const MCP_INSTRUCTIONS = `BrowserOS MCP Server — compact browser automation and 40+ external service integrations.

## Browser Automation

Observe → Act → Verify:
- Start with tabs action="list" to find page ids; it returns every open page.
- If navigation would disrupt a page the user is actively using, clone it by passing its listed URL to tabs action="new" and work in the new page.
- Use snapshot before interacting — it returns refs like [ref=e12].
- Use refs with act for click, fill, hover, select, press, scroll, and coordinate actions.
- Use navigate for url/back/forward/reload; it returns a fresh snapshot because refs are invalidated. It does not wait for the tab spinner.
- Use read or grep for page text, screenshot for visual state. Never wait for document.complete or the loading spinner; SPAs never finish. If wait times out, continue with the current page.
- Use run for page-context JavaScript only.

Obstacle handling:
- Cookie banners, popups → dismiss and continue.
- Login gates → notify user; proceed if credentials provided.
- CAPTCHA, 2FA → pause and ask user to resolve manually.

Error recovery:
- Ref not found → snapshot again; after navigation all refs are stale.
- Element not visible → act kind="scroll", snapshot, retry once.
- After 2 failed attempts → describe the blocker and ask user for guidance.

## External Integrations (Klavis Strata)

40+ services: Gmail, Slack, GitHub, Notion, Google Calendar, Jira, Linear, Figma, Salesforce, and more.

Before using any Strata integration, call connector_mcp_servers(server_name) to verify the service is connected.
- If connected → proceed with Strata discovery tools below.
- If not connected → prompt the user with the returned authUrl to authenticate. After they confirm, call connector_mcp_servers again to verify.

Progressive discovery — do not guess action names:
1. connector_mcp_servers → check connection status first.
2. discover_server_categories_or_actions → discover available actions.
3. get_category_actions → expand categories from step 2.
4. get_action_details → get parameter schema before executing.
5. execute_action → use include_output_fields to limit response size.
6. search_documentation → fallback keyword search.

Authentication — when execute_action returns an auth error:
1. Call connector_mcp_servers(server_name) to get a fresh authUrl.
2. Prompt the user to open the authUrl and authenticate.
3. Wait for explicit user confirmation before retrying.

## General

Execute independent tool calls in parallel when possible.
